## Project Plan 10/3/24 ##

- Introduce the core entities and their respective associations:	
	- ToDos (title, description, status, timestamps, category, notes, completed_at, target_date)
	- Notes (title, body, timestamps)
	- Categories (title, description, timestamps)
	- Project (title, target date, status, completed_at, timestamps) 


- MVC infrastructure for basic CRUD, focused on ToDos
	- Create a new todo
	- Edit existing todo
	- View todos
	- View single todo
	- Destroy todo

- Mobile-first design using bootstrap

- Add filtering using turbo/stimulus 
	- filter by status (pending, complete)
	- filter by date


## Optional but would like to do ##

- Test suite?

- Add calendar view to see completion dates, target dates for pending projects and ToDos 
	- Need datepicker on ToDo/Project form to select target dates 

- Support for multiple users, collaboration on todos
